# Used Car Price Prediction Model Pipeline
This repository contains a comprehensive machine-learning pipeline for predicting used car prices. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using advanced regression techniques. Key features include:

- [x] Data Handling: In-depth data cleaning, outlier detection, and categorical encoding.

- [x] Feature Engineering: Customized feature extraction and transformation based on car attributes like Manufacturer, Model, Category, and more.
- [x] Modeling: Implementing state-of-the-art models, including XGBoost and RandomForestRegressor, with hyperparameter tuning.
- [x] Evaluation: Robust evaluation metrics and visualization for model performance comparison.
- [x] Web Interface: An HTML-based form allowing users to input car details and predict prices in real-time.

This pipeline is ideal for data enthusiasts, automotive analysts, and machine learning practitioners looking to explore predictive modeling in the automotive domain.
